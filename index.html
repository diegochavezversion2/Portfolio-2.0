      <h2> A little more about Diego</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>I graduated high school and, like many others, was not sure what I wanted to do. I had tried many different careers but I was not passionate about them.</li>
          <li>After the pandemic I came accross the idea of learning how to code, and the excitement stuck with me.</li>
          <li>I let the idea marinate with me. After some time, I made the best decision to take the Thinkful bootcamp.</li>
          <li>Some of my other hobbies include excercising, playing video games, and I have a passion for cars.</li>
